# LG air conditioner serial protocol

The page contains discoveries made while trying to understand the serial protocol used by LG air conditioners. 
LG machines often include a dongle which connects to the main indoor board. 
The dongle communicates using serial communication. 

This work is in progress andI hope this can be helpful to other owners of LG units
I will be glad to receive further information other users may decode based on this crude initial draft. 

# Connector

The connector is labeled as CN_LINK 
in my unit it is a 8 position female connector with male terminals. 
only 4 positions are in use with below clarifications: 

1. GND
2. NC
3. 12V
4. NC
5. LG TX - 5V
6. LG RX - 5V
7. NC
8. NC

The physical connector is a rare type originating from South Korea
SMh200-8H
it uses a 2.0mm pitch 

It may be possible to use the more widely known type JST HY which has the same pitch and somehow similar form factor. 


# Protocol

The dongle and protocol seems to be common to a large variety of LG appliances, including dishwashers, fridges, kitchen hoods. 
in this page, i have only resarched about air conditioner. 

## Serial parameters

The dongle uses a quite traditional 8N1 setting: 
* 8 data bits
* no parity bit
* 1 stop bit
* 9600 bps


## Format of frames

all values from serial line are in hexadecimal

There is a request response exchange, either dongle or AC can initiate the request. 
interestingly it seems to be full duplex, i.e. it is possible to send response to previous request and simultaneously listen to new requests. 

### preamble

There is always a 4 byte preamble 
04 00 00 00 

### command
followed by a 3 byte command
0x65	0x02	0x01 (example for power off)

### sequence number
1 byte sequence number
The sequence number is incremented for every subsequent request of the same kind 
remains at 0x00 for single time commands

### length of payload
1 byte length of payload 
which apparently restricts the payload length to 255
in my expereince the largest payload has been 124

### variable payload 
The payload includes a set of 'type-lenght-value' data units. 
First 10 bits are for the data type (T)
Subsequent 2 bit indicate the length (L) in byte of the value, 
valid values is mostly 0 and 1.
Value of 0 means that only 2 bytes are used for the full TLV
Value OF 1 means that 3 bytes are used for the full TLV data unit. 
remaining 4 bits are for encoding the value, which indicate 16 values in the most basic TLV. 

To help identify the TLV, the full 2 bytes are used here
although only the 10 first bytes define the type of data unit

for example 
indoor temperature is 7f 50 as type
setpoint if 7f 90

### checksum CRC16

The two last bytes are CRC16 checksum of the entire frame including preamble to payload. 
The CRC polynom is CRC-XMODEM

### Example

A complete switch off command has the below content: 
0x04·0x00·0x00·0x00·0x65·0x02·0x01·0x00·0x02·0x7D·0xC0·0x73·0xC2



# known commands

## Switch on from dongle

complete serial frame: 
0x04·0x00·0x00·0x00·0x65·0x02·0x01·0x00·0x09·0x7D·0xC1·0x7E·0x40·0x7E·0x86·0x7F·0x90·0x2A·0x48·0x48

### Command 
0x65·0x02·0x01
### sequence
Sequence number is alway 0
### payload 7D (operation on off)
value C1 for switch on
value C0 for swtich off
### payload 7E (mode cool/auto/dehum..)
cooling		  40
dehum		    41
fan-only		42
auto		    43
### payload 7E (fan mode)
Fan speed | Code 
----- | ---
Auto|  88
1		|  82
2		|  83
3		|  84
4		|  85
5		|  86

### payload 7F90 (setpoint)
For some reason either the type is on 2 bytes with value 1 byte or the value is 2 bytes with value one byte
I have assumed that type is 2 bytes so far. 

The value of temperature in C is hex_value / 2

## switch off from dongle 
0x04·0x00·0x00·0x00·0x65·0x02·0x01·0x00·0x02·0x7D·0xC0·0x73·0xC2
### command 65 02 01
### payload 7D C0 
means request power off
### response from AC
0x04·0x00·0x00·0x00·0x87·0x02·0x10·0x00·0x00·0x77·0xE0
Above payload seems to be a 'standard' ack to a request from dongle 
#### ACK 87 02 10 
#### no payload


## update from AC 
sent on regular basis
### command 
0x87·0x02·0x04
### sequence number 
increments regularly 
as the AC sends command on regular basis
### Associated payloads
only one of the below payloads are seen with the command
#### payload 7F50 (indoor temperature)
0x7f·0x50·0x3d
type 7F 50
The value of temperature in C is hex_value / 2 and result converted to decimal.
Same as for setpoint. 
it only support .5 degree resolution.
